calorie intake tracker that calculates daily calorie needs based on user inputs like age, height, weight, and gender during signup.
After logging in, users can view their total calorie intake, add or search for food items, and delete mistakenly added items.
The app displays both current calorie intake and remaining allowance, issuing warnings if users exceed their limits.
Users can only view today's data, save it for future reference, and see graphical representations of their previous entries
